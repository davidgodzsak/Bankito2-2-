Drop some pills and make some sparkles :sparkling_heart:

### Run
Open index.html in your fav browser.

### Usage / Good to know

- Copy paste all the resources (content of .d-content from index.html, style.css, script.js, img/, font/) where you need to use it. 
- If position is not fixed anymore remove .pills { position:fixed; bottom: 0} and restylize accordingly
- If it's not needed to have 1240px max-width just remove it from .pills and .d-numbers
- To enable single bubble for mobile it is better to use dynamic rendering and render only one .pill -> however I have a responsive solution but make sure  to  add `    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
` to header to make it work
- Font is relatively accessed from style.css
- No other dependencies (vanillas JS, CSS)
- Consider resizing pictures for better download times.
